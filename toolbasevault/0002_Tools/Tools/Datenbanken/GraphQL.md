# [[GraphQL]]

# A query language for your API

GraphQL is a query language for [[API]]s and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developerÂ tools.

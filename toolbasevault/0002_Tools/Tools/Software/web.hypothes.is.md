# [[web.hypothes.is]]


## To enable a conversation over the world’s knowledge.

**Hypothesis Mission**

Hypothesis is a new effort to implement an old idea: A conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site.

[Our team](https://web.hypothes.is/team/) creates [open source software](https://web.hypothes.is/developers/), pushes for standards, and fosters community.

Using annotation, we enable sentence-level note taking or critique on top of classroom reading, news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. Everything we build is guided by [our principles](https://web.hypothes.is/principles/). In particular that it be [free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), open, neutral, and lasting to name a few.

Our efforts are based on the annotation standards for digital documents developed by the [W3C Web Annotation Working Group](http://w3.org/annotation). We are partnering broadly with developers, publishers, academic institutions, researchers, and individuals to [develop a platform](https://web.hypothes.is/developers/) for the next generation of read-write web applications. You can follow our development progress on our [roadmap](https://web.hypothes.is/roadmap/). Many have contributed [tools, plug-ins and integrations](https://web.hypothes.is/tools-plug-ins-and-integrations/).

Recently, the Hypothesis team formed [Anno](https://anno.co/), a public benefit corporation that shares the Hypothesis mission as well as its team. Anno will help scale Hypothesis in the higher education and research markets. The non-profit [Hypothesis Project](https://hypothesis-project.org/) will continue to focus on advocacy, standards and the development of the larger paradigm of open annotation beyond our implementation.

If you’d like to participate, [add our extension to your browser](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) and create an account, or [integrate annotation into your learning management system (LMS)](https://web.hypothes.is/education/lms/).

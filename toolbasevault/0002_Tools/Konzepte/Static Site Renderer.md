# [[Static Site Renderer]]

# JAM Stack
### JS, APIs, MD = JAM

#### JavaScript

Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.

#### APIs

Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function.

#### Markup

Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

Jamstack has revolutionized the way we think about building for the web by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.

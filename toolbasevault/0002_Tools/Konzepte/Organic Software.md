# [[Organic Software]]

https://pketh.org/organic-software
I’m open to the idea of selling ~5-10% equity in Kinopio for 💰 to live a smoother life right now. But the relatively-easy money of [[VC]]s has a cost – once you get on the VC ferris wheel 🎡, the primary goal of a business changes:

Before “lets make a great product and sell it to people who love it”

After 🎡 “we need fast growth to raise ever-higher rounds of investment until the company gets acquired, so I never have to work again”

This really clicked for me during a chat with someone who recently took VC:

> ![](https://pketh.org/images/2016/person2.svg) I like what I’m building, and if it dies it’ll be a shame. But it won’t kill me like it’s killing my baby that I would’ve loved to work on for the next 10+ yrs.

Maybe that’s the healthy approach, almost certainly the smart one – but it’s not mine. I want to work on Kinopio for at least a lifetime.

## Built to Die, and Secretive About It

Funding models explain why it’s so hard to rely on software services long-term. Not because of technical problems like crashes, but because they’re often built to die.

Two different kinds of farms can grow vegetables. One is a factory farm built for scale, and the other takes the time to grow more expensive but healthier plants without pesticides.

Will everyone appreciate the difference? Of course not, but the latter plants are labelled ‘organic’ to give us the information and the choice, so that those of us who do care can make better decisions.

## Organic Software

So maybe we should have ‘organic’ software as well, made by companies that:

1.  Are not funded in such a way where the primary obligation of the company is to 🎡 chase funding rounds or get acquired (so bootstrapping, crowdfunding, grants, and angel investment are okay)
2.  Have a clear pricing page
3.  Disclose their sources of funding and sources of revenue

And, if you are making organic software, please proudly tell the world because we want to know you’re making something we can rely on.
